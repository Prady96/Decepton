Our Aim?
--------

*_Detecting **Cheating in REAL TIME**_* using **Face recognition** we plan to create a system which uses personal characterstics such as face movements, eye movements to detect cheating in **online exams/Computer Based Test(CBT)**,

The methedology used behind involves the use of **facial landmark localization** to monitor the various movements, Furthur the implementation is done using Open Source library
